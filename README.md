## Documentation

The JavaScript source code is documented with [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/).

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) as a guideline for our versioning here.

### What does that mean?

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

And constructed with the following guidelines:

- Breaking backward compatibility bumps the `<major>` (and resets the `<minor>` and `<patch>`)
- New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the `<minor>` (and resets the `<patch>`)
- Bug fixes and misc. changes bumps the `<patch>`

### Development version

Please note that until we pass `v1.0.0` we are in **development version**.

That means you're using this code at your own risk until then, but we already love you =)
